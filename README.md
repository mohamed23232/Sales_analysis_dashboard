# Sales_analysis_dashboard

I have used Power Query and Excel to clean the data, analyze it, and get it ready for visualization
I have used Power BI to create the interactive visualization for the preprocessed data.
Dashboard Overview: in this dashboard, we can see the sales for each product, the quantity sold for each one, the most active time of the day for buying and how it's been sold for each month, and the top 5 cities in buying the products and we can filter this data by month, city and product 
by using such insights, we can enhance sales performance, increase revenue, and make data-driven decisions
